Cloud Computing
---------------------------------
Service delivery model over the internet (cloud). This includes but is not limited to
  # compute power meaning servers such as windows, linux, hosting environments, etc.
  # storage like files and/or databases
  # networking in azure but also outside when connecting to your company network
  # analytics services for visualization and telemetry data

Key concepts
-------------------
# scalability is the ability to scale, so allocate and deallocate resources at any time
# elasticity is the ability to scale dynamically
# agility is the ability to react fast (scale quickly)
# fault tolerance is the ability to maintain system uptime while physical and service component failures happen
# disaster recovery is the process and design principle which allows a system to recovers from natural or human induced disasters
# high availability is the agreed level of operational uptime for the system. It is a simple calculation of system uptime versus whole lifetime of the system.
  < < availability = uptime/(uptime + downtime) > >
